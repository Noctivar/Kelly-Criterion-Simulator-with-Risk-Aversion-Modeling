> 🧠 A simulation of optimal betting strategies under the Kelly Criterion — and how human bias breaks them.

## 📌 Overview

The **Kelly Criterion** provides a mathematically optimal way to size bets for maximum long-term growth. But people? We tend to overbet, underbet, or act emotionally.

This interactive Colab notebook lets you:

- 📈 **Visualize bankroll growth** using different risk attitudes  
- 🧪 **Experiment with human-like risk aversion or overconfidence**  
- ⚠️ **See how deviating from the Kelly optimal leads to ruin or stagnation**

## 🧮 Key Features

- 🎛️ Sliders for:
  - Risk Factor (0.1× to 2.0× of Kelly)
  - Initial Bankroll
  - Number of Rounds
- 📊 Two plots:
  - A single simulation with growth trajectory
  - 20 simulation ensemble with volatility bands
- 🧟‍♂️ “All-in” betting demo — to show how even a 60% win rate leads to ruin
- 📉 Risk assessment: how often you lose most of your money when deviating from optimal

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Kelly Criterion formula: `f* = (bp - q) / b`  
- Risk aversion vs overconfidence  
- Ruin theory (betting 100%)  
- Median vs expected growth  
- Utility theory (log vs linear)
